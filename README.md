# 100% Cuttable mask, designed for COVID-19 protection

100% Machinable head mask - non-homologated for health-care usage.

If you have a plotter, and some PVC sheets, you can build head masks at medium scale at home, or at large scale if you have industrial equipment. Whilst these masks have not passed any medical tests and therefore are not homologated for medical usage, it can definitely serve as a protective layer on other industries where human contact is unavoidable. 

By being fully manufactured using only one material - which can be a material whose disinfection is easy - it allows users to simply dive the full mask in a solution, and dry it again before reusage. Also, due to the velocity of manufacturing and relatively-low cost, it could also be used and thrown away, if the situation requires so.

## What are these masks?

Picture

These masks are made of acetate or PVC sheets. Each mask requires four pieces, that are assembled together to achieve the final result. Once assembled, it protects its user from accidental dissassemblies. Two straps are wrapped around the user's head, finishing in a 3-hole interlacing to ensure the masks are held tight. Excessive force is not required for attaching these masks, as their weight is extremely low, and PVC easily acquires static electricity, that further attaches the headband to the user's forehead.

## How are they made?

The most effective way of making these masks is through a die-cutting machine. We've designed and built ours using a Silhouette Cameo, but any device that machines plastic sheets would do. You'd need to download the designs - available in this repository or [here]() TODO Link. If your laminate sheets are A4-sized, you can download the sheet layout directly. If you have bigger machines, you can compose your own layout using the individual files, also included here - feel free to contribute back with your layout for easing others' task. 

If you compose your own layouts, please take a look at the pictures below for size references - all sizes are in _mm_.

### Can't I do them without a machine?

Technically, you could build your own mask using two printable A4 PVC sheets, a regular printer, some scissors or manual cutting tools, and lots of patiente. You can download the two PDF files included in this repository, and print them yourself.

## How are they built?

As mentioned above, each mask consists on four pieces.

TODO

Once you have these pieces available, you can follow this assembly procedure:

### Screen attachment

Attach the screen to the separator, using connectors **C** and **D**. **C** connector **must** pass through both holes, to ensure attachment. **D** are auxiliary connectors to keep everything in place, so one hole would do.

### Strap links

Use the **E** connectors at the end of each strap to attach them to the band. To do so, Loop through the **A** connectors of the band - start by the inner hole and finish in the outer one. The little loop that the straps do between **A** connectors will face outwards from users' face.

### Separator attachment

To finish the mask assembly, connect the band to the separator using **B** connectors. The separator part should face outwards, leaving **the screen closer to the band**. This ensures the mask stretches itself near the eye area, and avoids the mask to move too much when the user performs sudden movements.

## How are they used?

To use the mask, wrap the straps around your head, and use the **F** connectors from each strap to link both straps together. Pass the left strap through the three holes on the right strap, for full protection. Then, grab a strap's end with each hand, and pull firmly, but not too hard. The straps should adjust further, leaving the mask fixed in your head.

## How much do they cost?

We could buy 100 sheets for about 10â‚¬. At large scale, each mask takes about 1.8 sheets. This results in a material cost estimation of roughly 18 cents. 

With domestic settings, we calculated it takes, in average, 3 minutes to manipulate the materials and run quality checks on the pieces - all pieces that show imperfections on structural parts **must not be used**. Assembly time is not included, and should take between 3 and 5 minutes apiece.

We are manufacturing masks using our available materials, and putting our labor time and machine hours completely for free. However, there's only so much material we have available or that we can purchase with our personal money. Hence, we accept donations of materials that we could use for manufacturing, as well as cash donations for purchasing them ourselves. If you like this initiative, you can donate here.
