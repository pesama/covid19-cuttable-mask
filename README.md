If you have a plotter, and some PVC sheets, you can build head masks at medium scale at home, or at large scale if you have industrial equipment. Whilst these masks have not passed any medical tests and therefore are not homologated for medical usage, it can definitely serve as a protective layer on other industries where human contact is unavoidable. 

By being fully manufactured using only one material - which can be a material whose disinfection is easy - it allows users to simply dive the full mask in a solution, and dry it again before reusage. Also, due to the velocity of manufacturing and relatively-low cost, it could also be used and thrown away, if the situation requires so.

## What are these masks?

These masks are made of acetate or PVC sheets. Each mask requires four pieces, that are assembled together to achieve the final result. Once assembled, it protects its user from accidental dissassemblies. Two straps are wrapped around the user's head, finishing in a 3-hole interlacing to ensure the masks are held tight. Excessive force is not required for attaching these masks, as their weight is extremely low, and PVC easily acquires static electricity, that further attaches the headband to the user's forehead.

## How are they made?

The most effective way of making these masks is through a die-cutting machine, capable of cutting through PVC sheets. You'd also need to download the compatible files for your device, from the list above. If your laminate sheets are A4-sized, you can download the sheet layout directly. 



If you have bigger machines, you can compose your own layout using the individual files, also included here - feel free to contribute back with your layout for easing others' task. If you compose your own layouts, please take a look at the size reference below - all sizes are in _mm_.

* **Band:** 290x30mm
* **Separator:** 292,94x28,08mm
* **Left strap:** 224,08x22,63mm
* **Right strap:** 226,39x25,03mm

The process must completely cut through the material - specially in the wholes and link marks. **PVC sheets are extremely fragile when bent over after being cut, if the cut is not deep enough.**

### Can't I do them without a machine?

Technically, you could build your own mask using two printable A4 PVC sheets, a regular printer, some scissors or manual cutting tools, and lots of patiente. You can download the two PDF files included in this repository, and print them yourself.

## How are they built?

As mentioned above, each mask consists on four pieces.

Once you have these pieces available, you can follow this assembly procedure

### Screen attachment

Attach the screen to the separator, using connectors **C** and **D**. **C** connector **must** pass through both holes, to ensure attachment. **D** are auxiliary connectors to keep everything in place, so one hole would do.

### Strap links

Use the **E** connectors at the end of each strap to attach them to the band. To do so, Loop through the **A** connectors of the band - start by the inner hole and finish in the outer one. The little loop that the straps do between **A** connectors will face outwards from users' face.

### Separator attachment

To finish the mask assembly, connect the band to the separator using **B** connectors. The separator part should face outwards, leaving **the screen closer to the band**. This ensures the mask stretches itself near the eye area, and avoids the mask to move too much when the user performs sudden movements.

## How are they used?

To use the mask, wrap the straps around your head, and use the **F** connectors from each strap to link both straps together. Pass the left strap through the three holes on the right strap, for full protection. Then, grab a strap's end with each hand, and pull firmly, but not too hard. The straps should adjust further, leaving the mask fixed in your head.
